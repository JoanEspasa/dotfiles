# My dotfiles

Collection of dotfiles for \*nix environment

## vim

Using Vundle as a plugin manager: <https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim>

- Ensure term has `$TERM = xterm-256color`
- Copy `.vimrc` file into `~`
- Follow install instructions from Vundle

## bash

Not much here. For now using powerline-shell to beautify a bit:

```sh
$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
```

after installing full fonts with nice gliphs and reboot.

- Install and follow instructions from <https://github.com/b-ryan/powerline-shell>
- Copy powerline-shell config file to `.config/powerline-shell/`
